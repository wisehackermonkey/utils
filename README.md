# Event to Google Calendar URL Generator

A simple tool that uses Claude to parse event information and generate Google Calendar invitation URLs.

## What it does

This script takes event information (from text, clipboard, or a file), parses it using Claude, and generates a shareable Google Calendar URL. When someone clicks this URL, a pre-filled calendar event opens with all the extracted information.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/event-to-gcal-generator.git
   cd event-to-gcal-generator
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install anthropic pyperclip
   ```

3. Set your Anthropic API key as an environment variable:
**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

## Usage

Run the script in one of these ways:

```
# Parse text from clipboard
python event_to_gcal.py

# Parse text from a file
python event_to_gcal.py event_info.txt

# Parse directly provided text
python event_to_gcal.py "Cinnamon Rools, Thursday Mar 6 at 7:00pm, 123 Event St San Francisco, CA"
```

The script will:
1. Extract event details (title, date, time, location, description)
2. Generate a Google Calendar URL
3. Print the URL and copy it to your clipboard
4. Automatically open the URL in your default web browser

## Example

```
